# BFSI Insights Coding Practices

This file contains project-specific coding rules for AI assistants (Windsurf/Cursor).
These rules are learned from bugs, incidents, and code reviews.

---

## Data Consistency

### Pipeline Status Queries (KB-202)
- **Always use `status_code`** (numeric) for pipeline status queries, never `status` (text)
- When querying `ingestion_queue`, always select the `status_code` field
- Status codes are defined in `docs/architecture/pipeline-status-codes.md`:
  - `200` = PENDING_ENRICHMENT
  - `300` = PENDING_REVIEW (items ready for human review)
  - `330` = APPROVED
  - `400` = PUBLISHED
  - `500` = FAILED
  - `540` = REJECTED

### Query Pattern Consistency
- Dashboard and all UI views must use **identical query logic** for the same data
- No client-side filtering that duplicates or contradicts DB-level filters
- When adding a new view of existing data, check how other views query it first

---

## TypeScript / React

### Unused Variables
- Prefix intentionally unused variables with `_` (e.g., `status: _status`)
- Remove truly unused imports/variables rather than prefixing

### React Hooks
- Define `useCallback` handlers **before** `useEffect` hooks that reference them
- Include all dependencies in useEffect/useCallback dependency arrays
- Use `useMemo` for expensive computations, with eslint-disable if needed for impure functions

### Component Props
- Keep prop names consistent across interface and destructuring
- Use `propName: _propName` syntax when prop is required but unused locally

---

## Linting

- **Zero lint errors** before committing (warnings acceptable if pre-existing)
- Run `npm run lint` in admin-next before every commit
- If adding eslint-disable, always include a comment explaining why

---

## Git Workflow

- Never commit directly to main
- Branch naming: `feat/kb-XXX-desc`, `fix/kb-XXX-desc`, `improve/kb-XXX-desc`
- Include Linear issue ID in commits: `fix(KB-XXX): description`
- Create PR immediately after first push to start CI

---

## Adding New Rules

When you encounter a bug or incident:
1. Identify the **root cause pattern** (not just the symptom)
2. Add a rule here that would have prevented it
3. Include the Linear issue ID for context (e.g., KB-202)
