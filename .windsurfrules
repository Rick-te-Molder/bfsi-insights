# BFSI Insights Project Rules

## Task Completion
When completing tasks, provide a Linear-ready summary per CONTRIBUTING.md section 7:
- Problem, Root Cause, Solution, Files Changed, PR link

## Workflow
- Never commit directly to main - always use branches and PRs
- Branch naming: `feat/kb-XXX-desc`, `fix/kb-XXX-desc`, `docs/desc`
- Include Linear issue ID in commits: `fix(KB-XXX): description`

## Code Style
- Keep files under 500 lines (enforced by pre-commit)
- Use TypeScript/Astro conventions from existing code
- Run `npm run lint` before committing
