    "note": "## The Transformation of the Insurance Industry by 2030\n\nThe insurance industry is approaching a major transformation driven by **artificial intelligence (AI)**. By 2030, carriers will shift from a *detect and repair* model to *predict and prevent*, leveraging massive data flows and cognitive technologies.\n\n### Four Key Trends\n\n1. **Connected devices** will surge, providing real-time behavioral and usage data.\n2. **Robotics and autonomous systems** will reshape risk pools.\n3. **Open data ecosystems and shared platforms** will expand.\n4. **Deep learning advances** will enable intelligent automation of underwriting, claims, and pricing.\n\n### Impacts on Operations\n\n- Distribution will become instantaneous.\n- Underwriting will occur in near real time.\n- Claims will be highly automated, with human intervention limited to complex cases.\n\n### What Carriers Must Do\n\nTo succeed, carriers must:\n\n- Build an **AI-aware culture**.\n- Create **comprehensive data strategies**.\n- Overhaul **technology and talent**.\n- Define **strategic visions** for new business models.\n\nThose who treat this shift as an opportunity rather than a threat will be best positioned for the future.",

    "note": "## Generative and Agentic AI: A Major Inflection Point for Insurers\n\n**Generative AI (gen AI)** and **agentic AI** mark a major turning point for the insurance industry. Unlike earlier analytics, gen AI introduces *reasoning*, *creativity*, and *empathy*—traits highly relevant to underwriting, claims, and customer service.\n\n### AI Across the Value Chain\n\nInsurers are applying AI in:\n\n- **Sales**\n- **Underwriting**\n- **Claims**\n- **Back-office operations**\n- **Customer servicing**\n\nThese uses aim to automate workflows and personalise customer experiences.\n\n### What's Needed to Deliver Value\n\nTo achieve real impact, insurers must move beyond isolated pilots and:\n\n- Define a **clear, enterprise-wide AI vision**.\n- Undertake **deep workflow rewiring**.\n- Build **modern data and technology stacks**.\n- Develop **scalable, reusable components**.\n\n### The Future of Onboarding\n\nFuture onboarding could involve **multi-agent AI systems** that:\n\n1. Intake customer and third-party data.\n2. Build risk profiles.\n3. Price policies.\n4. Review compliance.\n5. Escalate only when human judgment is required.\n\n### The Competitive Divide\n\nInsurers who **invest now** and **embed AI end-to-end** will process more business, faster—gaining better risk insight and offering more personal service. Those who **only experiment** risk falling behind.",

    "note": "## Understanding Multi-Agent LLM System Failures\n\nThis paper investigates why **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** built with multiple large-language-model (LLM) agents often underperform despite high expectations.\n\n### Research Methodology\n\nThe authors collected:\n\n- **1,600+ execution traces** from seven MAS frameworks\n- Tests using modern LLMs (*GPT-4*, *Claude*, *CodeLlama*)\n- The **first large dataset** of MAS failures\n\n### Taxonomy of 14 Failure Modes\n\nFailures grouped into three categories:\n\n#### 1. System Design Issues\n\n- Unclear agent roles\n- Repeated steps\n- Poor workflow structure\n\n#### 2. Inter-Agent Misalignment\n\n- Agents ignoring each other\n- Failure to ask clarifying questions\n- Communication breakdowns\n\n#### 3. Task Verification Failures\n\n- Incomplete output checks\n- Incorrect validation logic\n- Missing quality controls\n\n### Key Finding\n\nMany failures stem **not just from the LLM models themselves** but from:\n\n- Architectural design\n- Coordination mechanisms\n- Verification processes\n\n### Research Impact\n\nThe dataset and taxonomy are **publicly released** to help guide better MAS design and research.",
