This manipulation leads to semantic drift, altering the behavior of LLMs, which is particularly concerning for the BFSI sector where security is paramount.",
    "summary_long": "The paper presents CompressionAttack, an attack surface that targets how LLM-powered agents compress or shorten prompts before execution. Many agent systems compress long instructions to save tokens or meet context limits, but this transformation can unintentionally reveal or amplify hidden malicious behavior. The authors demonstrate that attackers can design prompts that look benign before compression yet become harmful afterwards, allowing hidden instructions to slip past guardrails and alignment checks. Through experiments on multiple models and tool-using frameworks, they show how CompressionAttack can be used to gain unauthorized tool access, leak sensitive information, or manipulate automated decisions. The work analyzes why naive prompt filtering is insufficient and recommends mitigation strategies such as compression-aware filtering, safer intermediate representations, and checks on both pre- and post-compression prompts. For BFSI and other regulated industries, the paper highlights the need to treat prompt-handling infrastructure as part of the security surface, not just the model itself.",
