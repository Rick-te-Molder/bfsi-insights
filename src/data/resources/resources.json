    "note": "## Generative and Agentic AI: A Major Inflection Point for Insurers\n\n**Generative AI (gen AI)** and **agentic AI** mark a major turning point for the insurance industry. Unlike earlier analytics, gen AI introduces *reasoning*, *creativity*, and *empathy*—traits highly relevant to underwriting, claims, and customer service.\n\n### AI Across the Value Chain\n\nInsurers are applying AI in:\n\n- **Sales**\n- **Underwriting**\n- **Claims**\n- **Back-office operations**\n- **Customer servicing**\n\nThese uses aim to automate workflows and personalise customer experiences.\n\n### What's Needed to Deliver Value\n\nTo achieve real impact, insurers must move beyond isolated pilots and:\n\n- Define a **clear, enterprise-wide AI vision**.\n- Undertake **deep workflow rewiring**.\n- Build **modern data and technology stacks**.\n- Develop **scalable, reusable components**.\n\n### The Future of Onboarding\n\nFuture onboarding could involve **multi-agent AI systems** that:\n\n1. Intake customer and third-party data.\n2. Build risk profiles.\n3. Price policies.\n4. Review compliance.\n5. Escalate only when human judgment is required.\n\n### The Competitive Divide\n\nInsurers who **invest now** and **embed AI end-to-end** will process more business, faster—gaining better risk insight and offering more personal service. Those who **only experiment** risk falling behind.",

    "summary_medium": "Basically, they discovered AI can totally transform insurance if done right. Top players see 6x returns. AI slashes costs, boosts sales, and improves claims accuracy. Success needs a bold, enterprise-wide AI strategy, focusing on embedding AI deeply into operations rather than just dabbling with tech.",
    "summary_long": "## Context\nAI is shaking up industries, and insurance is no exception. Like the internet changed shopping, AI is shifting how insurers handle everything from sales to claims.\n\n## Relevance  \nFor BFSI folks, it's crucial to know that AI can drive massive gains. Insurers using AI right are seeing serious boosts in efficiency and returns.\n\n## Key Insights  \nInsurers fully diving into AI are seeing 6.1 times the total shareholder returns over those just dabbling. AI in claims processing, like Aviva's, cuts liability assessment times and customer complaints. Successful adopters focus on domain-wide transformations, not just small pilot projects. Plus, AI can cut new customer onboarding costs by up to 40% and improve claims accuracy by 3-5%. It's all about integrating AI deeply and not just slapping on new tech here and there.",

This lack of alignment causes errors and inefficiencies. The paper suggests developing frameworks to ensure these agents can better communicate and align their objectives, potentially improving overall system performance.",
