  "note": "## Generative and Agentic AI: A Major Inflection Point for Insurers\n\n**Generative AI (gen AI)** and **agentic AI** mark a major turning point for the insurance industry. Unlike earlier analytics, gen AI introduces *reasoning*, *creativity*, and *empathy*—traits highly relevant to underwriting, claims, and customer service.\n\n### AI Across the Value Chain\n\nInsurers are applying AI in:\n\n- **Sales**\n- **Underwriting**\n- **Claims**\n- **Back-office operations**\n- **Customer servicing**\n\nThese uses aim to automate workflows and personalise customer experiences.\n\n### What's Needed to Deliver Value\n\nTo achieve real impact, insurers must move beyond isolated pilots and:\n\n- Define a **clear, enterprise-wide AI vision**.\n- Undertake **deep workflow rewiring**.\n- Build **modern data and technology stacks**.\n- Develop **scalable, reusable components**.\n\n### The Future of Onboarding\n\nFuture onboarding could involve **multi-agent AI systems** that:\n\n1. Intake customer and third-party data.\n2. Build risk profiles.\n3. Price policies.\n4. Review compliance.\n5. Escalate only when human judgment is required.\n\n### The Competitive Divide\n\nInsurers who **invest now** and **embed AI end-to-end** will process more business, faster—gaining better risk insight and offering more personal service. Those who **only experiment** risk falling behind.",
