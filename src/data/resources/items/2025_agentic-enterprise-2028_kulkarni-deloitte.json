  "note": "This Deloitte report outlines how agentic AI will transform enterprises by 2028 across cost, speed, and growth. It proposes a multi-agent operating model where agents orchestrate workflows end-to-end—intake, analysis, action, and verification—with humans in the loop for oversight and exceptions. Value comes from automating repeatable processes, improving decision quality, and enabling new services. The blueprint stresses data readiness, reusable agent components, safe execution (guardrails/observability), and change management. It recommends staged rollout (prove → scale → industrialize) with platform investments in orchestration, tool connectors, monitoring, and governance. Organizations that build an enterprise agent platform early will capture compounding advantages in efficiency and innovation.",
