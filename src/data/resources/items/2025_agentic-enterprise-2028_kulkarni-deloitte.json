  "summary_short": "Hey, this paper found that agentic AI can slash costs, speed up product releases, and create high-value jobs. It's about using AI smartly, not just automating tasks.",
  "summary_medium": "Basically, they discovered that agentic AI isn't just about automating tasks. It's a game-changer for cost savings and faster growth. By 2028, companies using it can cut costs, get products out faster, and create new roles focused on strategic oversight. It's about integrating AI into the very fabric of business operations, transforming how companies work.",
  "summary_long": "## Context\nThe report looks at how agentic AI is set to revolutionize business operations by 2028. Companies are under pressure to innovate, reduce costs, and manage talent better.\n\n## Relevance\nFor BFSI folks, this means smarter, quicker processes and new job roles. It's not just about automation but using AI to make strategic decisions and enhance customer interactions.\n\n## Key Insights\nThey found agentic AI can dramatically reduce operating costs and speed up time-to-market by allowing AI 'agents' to independently handle tasks. These agents need good data and governance to work effectively. Early movers will set industry standards, so starting now can give companies a competitive edge. Plus, it opens up new roles as employees shift to higher-value work, focusing on strategic oversight and orchestration."
