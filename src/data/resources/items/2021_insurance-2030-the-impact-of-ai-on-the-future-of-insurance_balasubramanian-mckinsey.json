  "note": "The insurance industry is approaching a major transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). By 2030, carriers will shift from a “detect and repair” model to “predict and prevent,” leveraging massive data flows and cognitive technologies. Four key trends will shape this: (1) a surge in connected devices providing real-time behavioral and usage data, (2) greater use of robotics and autonomous systems that reshape risk pools, (3) the growth of open data ecosystems and shared platforms, and (4) advances in deep learning enabling intelligent automation of underwriting, claims and pricing. Distribution will become instantaneous, underwriting near-real-time and claims highly automated, with human intervention reserved for complex cases. To succeed carriers must act now: build an AI-aware culture, create comprehensive data strategies, overhaul technology and talent, and define strategic visions for new business models. Those who treat this shift as opportunity rather than threat will be best positioned. ",
