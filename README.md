## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:
```
bfsi-insights/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inbox/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ urls.txt
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resources/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ items/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ schemas/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ kb.schema.json
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ add-url.mjs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ingest.mjs
â””â”€â”€ node_modules/
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |

## Workflow Summary

1. See a link â†’ paste into `src/data/inbox/urls.txt` (or run `npm run add:url -- <URL>`)
2. Run `npm run ingest`
3. The script creates `src/data/resources/items/YYYYMMDD_slug_hash.json`
4. Your build reads `src/data/resources.json` and renders the site

## Quick Start
```sh
npm run add:url -- https://example.com/some-report
npm run ingest
npm run build
```
